        <h2>Stockhom the Capital of Scandinavia</h2>
        <p>With over 700 miles of bike lanes, Stockholm is perfect for cycling.
            There are bike paths and bike lanes all over and you can easily get around between         the areas of inner-city Stockholm
            and out on Djurgården, an area of outstanding natural beauty.</p>
                
        <p>Many locals opt for a bike when commuting to work, or just getting around.
            But if you're visiting you've probably left your bike back home.</p>
                
        <p>Luckily there are plenty of bike rental shops spread across town,
            great either for anyone who wants a relaxing afternoon trip or planning a
            cycling weekend on the islands of the Stockholm archipelago.</p>

        <h2>Summer barbecue</h2>
        <p>This summer, the Argentinian chef Francis Mallmann, a legend in live-fire cookery, published Green Fire, <br> 
            a book exploring “extraordinary” ways to grill vegetables.<br> 
            Consider it a significant marker, as the notion of creating stellar dishes around barbecued vegetables becomes more popular.</p>

        <h2>Climate crisis</h2>
        <p>Floods, storms and heatwaves are a direct product of the climate crisis that is a fact, <br>
            so where is the action? As Guardian analysis reveals that human-caused global heating <br> 
            is driving more frequent and deadly weather disasters, there is no place for denialism any more</p>

        <h2>Is British Museum's stance shifting on Parthenon marbles return?</h2>
        <p>A glance at the social media channels of the British Museum underlines why, when it comes to the long-disputed Acropolis sculptures,<br> 
            it is so eager to “change the temperature of the debate”.<br>
            Those were the words used this week by the museum's deputy director, Jonathan Williams,<br> 
            as he called for a new “positive partnership” with Greece over the marbles.</p>

        <h2>Contemplation can help problem-solving<br>
            and boost creativity, study claims</h2>
        <p>Losing oneself in one's thoughts or letting the mind wander is an underrated<br> 
            activity that is more rewarding the more it is practised,<br>
            an academic study has claimed.
            Psychologists who studied a group of more than 250 people encouraged to<br> 
            engage in directionless contemplation or free-floating thinking said that the<br> 
            activity was far more satisfying than the participants had anticipated.</p>
