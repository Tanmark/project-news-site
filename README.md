# News Site

Creating a news site, mobile first apporach and specific columns requested for tablet and desktop size devices.

## The problem
I started out by doing all the excercises provided from Technigo and read most of the litterature provided. Planned out the project in Figma 
(although that is not the finsihed product) If I had more time I would ask the group some questions.

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
